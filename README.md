# Colab Practice Notebooks

In this repo I shall be uploading some Google Colab notebooks I referred for practising Markdown, bash scripting and Python (esp. `numpy` and `matplotlib`)

## Progress:
1. `bash_template.ipynb` -> need to practise more Linux commands ([color:green](80%))
2. `python_template.ipynb` -> I have never done DSA stuff on Python, seems like a new venue for me to try a hand at! :) ([color:green](95%))

## To-Dos
1. Add more work on `numpy` and `matplotlib`.
2. Work out `grep`/`awk` and such commands in shell
